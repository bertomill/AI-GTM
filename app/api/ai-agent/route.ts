ASSIGNMENT CONTEXT:
Robert Mill is presenting his strategic analysis to KPMG's internal steering group for a Senior Consultant – AI Solutions & Go-to-Market role.

Scenario: KPMG's Tax practice has recently piloted a generative AI tool designed to review tax-related contracts and extract key metadata. The tool has delivered promising results—but adoption has been limited to a small pilot group.

Challenge: Leadership is now looking to scale the use of AI across broader Tax functions, but they are encountering inconsistent interest, low engagement, and general uncertainty about AI across their teams.

Audience: Internal steering group (Tax, Product, and Technology leaders)

Format: 20-minute strategic presentation with discussion and Q&A

Key Topics to Address:
- Root cause analysis of slow adoption barriers
- Strategic approach to uncover people, process, technology, and cultural barriers
- Comprehensive internal rollout and awareness strategy
- Targeted messaging, communication channels, and supporting materials
- Stakeholder engagement tactics for AI-skeptical leadership
- Required support structures, training programs, and change management
- Success metrics, KPIs, milestones, and performance tracking framework

ROBERT'S CIBC EXPERIENCE & PROVEN RESULTS:
At CIBC, Robert scaled an internal knowledge-based search tool with ChatGPT-like Q&A capabilities from 300 to 15,000 users. Key insights from this experience:
- Pilot group shows 40% efficiency gains in contract review
- Limited adoption due to lack of awareness and training
- Middle management skepticism about AI reliability
- No clear success metrics or ROI demonstration

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (Based on Robert's Enterprise AI Rollouts):

1. **Workflow Resistance** (Based on Robert's CIBC experience with 15,000+ user rollout):
   - Employees have established workflows and resist changing "how things are done"
   - Fear that AI outputs will compromise work quality and professional standards
   - Preference for familiar manual processes over new AI-assisted workflows
   - Concern about accountability when using AI-generated recommendations

2. **Tool Perception & Quality Concerns** (Common enterprise AI adoption barriers Robert has observed):
   - Internal AI tools perceived as inferior to external options (ChatGPT, Claude)
   - Hallucination concerns: "AI always makes mistakes and unreliable responses"
   - Quality directly correlates with user skill - poor results blamed on tool, not technique
   - Lack of understanding that AI is a productivity multiplier, not replacement

3. **Training & Change Management Gaps** (Critical success factors from Robert's enterprise rollouts):
   - Voluntary training has low completion rates - mandatory training drives adoption
   - Insufficient hands-on practice with real work scenarios during training
   - No clear escalation path when users encounter tool limitations
   - "Thank me later" approach: Initial resistance transforms into appreciation with proper onboarding

4. **KPMG Tax-Specific Challenges** (Professional services considerations Robert has identified):
   - Client-facing work requires higher confidence in AI accuracy than internal processes
   - Tax regulations change frequently - concerns about AI training data currency
   - Billable hour model creates pressure to maintain traditional efficiency metrics
   - Professional liability considerations when AI assists in client deliverables

ROBERT'S STRATEGIC DISCOVERY QUESTIONS:

**Question 1: Stakeholder Priorities**
"What are each of your primary success metrics for this AI rollout? What does success look like from each perspective?"

Follow-up Topics Robert Explores:
- How do you personally define "successful AI adoption"?
- What metrics will you be tracking in your monthly reports?
- How does this align with your department's broader objectives?
- What would make you personally look good to your leadership?
- What are your biggest concerns if this initiative fails?

Example Positive Responses Robert Typically Hears:
- Tax Practice Lead: "50% reduction in contract review time while maintaining quality. Improved billable hour utilization."
- Technology Head: "75% user adoption rate with less than 5% support ticket volume. Seamless integration with existing workflows."
- Product Manager: "Daily active usage by month 3. Positive NPS scores above 70. Feature utilization across core functions."

Potential Objections & Concerns Robert Addresses:
- Quality Concerns: "I'm worried AI will introduce errors that hurt our client relationships."
- ROI Skepticism: "Training costs might outweigh efficiency gains, especially if adoption is low."
- Workflow Disruption: "Our teams are already stretched thin - this might slow us down initially."
- Measurement Challenges: "It's hard to measure 'efficiency' in our complex, relationship-driven work."

**Question 2: Resource Reality**
"What level of time investment are we realistically able to ask from our tax professionals during rollout phases?"

Follow-up Topics Robert Investigates:
- What does "busy season" look like and how does that affect training schedules?
- Are you willing to mandate training time, or must it be voluntary?
- What's the realistic window for initial learning curve productivity dips?
- How do billable hour expectations affect time available for training?
- What support do managers need to protect training time?

Example Realistic Responses Robert Has Encountered:
- Conservative: "1-2 hours per week maximum. Must be outside busy season (Sept-April). Needs manager approval."
- Moderate: "3-4 hours in first month, then 1 hour monthly. Can mandate if we see clear ROI."
- Aggressive: "Full day initial training plus weekly practice time. Treat as billable professional development."

Common Resource Constraints Robert Navigates:
- Billable Hour Pressure: "Non-billable training time directly impacts our revenue targets."
- Client Deadlines: "Tax deadlines are non-negotiable. Training can't interfere with client deliverables."
- Generational Resistance: "Senior professionals may resist spending time learning new tools."
- Competing Priorities: "We have 3 other technology initiatives rolling out simultaneously."

**Question 3: Organizational Dynamics**
"Based on previous technology implementations, what has been our biggest organizational barrier?"

Follow-up Topics Robert Examines:
- Which groups typically embrace new technology vs. resist it?
- How do partners vs. managers vs. staff respond differently?
- What specific fears or concerns have come up in the past?
- How does client-facing work affect willingness to adopt new tools?
- What made previous technology rollouts successful or unsuccessful?

Common Organizational Patterns Robert Has Observed:
- The "Proven Process" Mindset: "We've always done it this way and it works fine."
- Risk Aversion: "What if the AI makes a mistake on a client deliverable?"
- Authority Dynamics: "Senior staff don't want to look less knowledgeable than junior staff."
- Change Fatigue: "We just finished implementing the last system - not another change."

What Usually Works (Based on Robert's Experience):
- Partner Sponsorship: "When senior partners visibly use and endorse the tool."
- Peer Champions: "Respected colleagues sharing real success stories."
- Gradual Introduction: "Start with non-critical tasks to build confidence."
- Quick Wins: "Show immediate, tangible benefits in first few uses."
