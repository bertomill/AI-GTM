## Pre-Meeting Coaching Points

### Opening Strategy (First 2 minutes)
1. **Hook with Impact:** Start with the pilot's 40% efficiency gain
2. **Frame the Challenge:** Position as organizational, not technical problem
3. **Set Expectations:** Clear agenda with time for their questions

### Key Messaging Framework
- **Problem:** Limited adoption despite proven technology
- **Solution:** Systematic change management approach
- **Benefit:** Scalable AI adoption across entire tax function
- **Ask:** Support for 4-phase rollout plan

## Presentation Flow & Coaching

### Phase 1: Problem Diagnosis (5 minutes)
**Your Goal:** Establish credibility and shared understanding

**Coach Notes:**
- Use data from pilot to build confidence
- Acknowledge stakeholder concerns upfront
- Position yourself as solution-focused consultant

**Potential Pushback:** "Why isn't the pilot just expanding naturally?"  
**Your Response:** "Great question, Sarah. Our analysis shows adoption barriers are systemic - awareness, training, and change management gaps that require intentional strategy."

### Phase 2: Strategic Solution (8 minutes)
**Your Goal:** Present comprehensive but digestible plan

**Coach Notes:**
- Break down 4-phase approach clearly
- Address each stakeholder's concerns specifically
- Use visual aids effectively (your web app)

**Potential Pushback:** "This seems resource-intensive. What's the ROI?"  
**Your Response:** "Marcus, I understand the investment concern. Based on pilot data, we project 50% time savings per contract review. For 200 users processing 1000 contracts monthly, that's 500 hours saved - roughly $75K monthly in billable time recovery."

### Phase 3: Implementation Details (5 minutes)
**Your Goal:** Show practical, actionable next steps

**Coach Notes:**
- Be specific about timelines and resources
- Show you've thought through execution challenges
- Demonstrate project management competency

### Phase 4: Q&A Strategy (10 minutes)
**Your Goal:** Address concerns and build consensus

## Common Questions & Coached Responses

### Q: "What if staff resist this change?"
**Coach Notes:** Show empathy, then pivot to solution
**Your Response:** "That's exactly why we're starting with champions, not mandates. People need to see peers succeeding before they'll embrace change. Our phase 1 focuses on identifying natural advocates who can become internal evangelists."

### Q: "How do we ensure quality doesn't suffer?"
**Coach Notes:** Address the core fear directly
**Your Response:** "Quality is non-negotiable, Dr. Walsh. That's why our metrics include quality scores alongside efficiency. The AI handles data extraction - professionals still make all judgments and client-facing decisions."

### Q: "What's different about your approach vs. other tech rollouts?"
**Coach Notes:** Differentiate through change management focus
**Your Response:** "Most tech rollouts focus on features. We're focusing on people. Every phase includes feedback loops, peer mentoring, and iterative improvements based on user experience."

## Success Metrics for This Meeting

1. **Engagement:** All three stakeholders ask follow-up questions
2. **Buy-in:** At least two stakeholders express support
3. **Next Steps:** Clear agreement on Phase 1 pilot expansion
4. **Credibility:** Position yourself as strategic partner, not just consultant

## Post-Meeting Debrief Questions

1. Did you address each stakeholder's primary concerns?
2. Were you specific enough about implementation details?
3. Did you balance confidence with openness to feedback?
4. How well did you use data to support your arguments?

## Role-Play Script Starter

**You:** "Thank you all for your time today. I know we're all committed to scaling our AI capabilities in Tax, and I'm excited to share a strategic approach that builds on our pilot's success while addressing the adoption challenges we've identified.

Sarah, I know client service is your top priority. Marcus, I've incorporated your technical requirements. And Jennifer, I think you'll appreciate the user-centric design of this rollout.
